<h2>  My Experience with Web Design and Development has been a 
    learning and rewarding process in the knowledge and understanding 
    of getting the overall fundamentals and steps it takes to being 
    successful in this field of study.

<h2>   What I hope to gain from this course is learning a new skill set that 
    I can use that will benefitme as I continue to pursue my degree.

<h2>   What I would like to do with my new web design knowledge in the future 
    is to be able to create a website that I could be proud to show all the 
    skills that I have learned while doing my craft. </p>
